RevScarecrow on Twitch had the idea to stream a D&D-like game where he would be the DM, and the audience would colectively play as the PC.
However, he put together the entire game interface with duct tape , willpower, and OBS.
I tried putting together a little Forms program as a sketch of my idea of how an actual program for the game would work. Some features are missing, like adding draggable figures to the scene (which was definitely doable, albeit annoying to execute in Forms).
It runs in two windows, one containing the player interface, and the other containing a control panel for the streamer. 
All features in the control panel are working, though some of the visual assets are missing (only the Church and Outside Starbucks scenes are actually in).

UI design isn't mine, I just tried to make it as true to source material as I could, without access to Rev's actual files.

I'd love to eventually flesh this out if Rev or another streamer would like to use it! And I promise it wouldn't be done in Forms.
